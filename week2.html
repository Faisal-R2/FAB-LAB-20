			<h3> Assignment :</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Individual assignment: Model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate,a possible final project,compress your images and videos, and post it on your class page.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Before I am going to Software Portion , first I will define about the Vector and Reaster in 2D and 3D Designs </p>
			<h3> 2D design </h3>
			<p> A 2d design professional draws 2-dimensional, or flat, images used in mechanical drawings, electrical engineering projects, video games, animation, clothing construction and architecture.What makes 2D so powerful? Drawing, Graphic Design, Photography, Painting, Video, and many other art disciplines rely on a designerâ€™s ability to use the concepts learned in this course in order to communicate. All the elements of 2D make up a visual language that helps artists to communicate creatively and effectively while utilizing a wide variety of materials. The concepts you will learn have practical applications that help you express yourself in unique, artistic ways. for more detaits <a href="http://www.adrianartblog.com/2d-design.html"> <b> HERE </b> </a> </p>

            <h3> Raster Graphics</h3>

            <p> Raster images use bit maps to store information. This means a large file needs a large bitmap. The larger the image, the more disk space the image file will take up. As an example, a 640 x 480 image requires information to be stored for 307,200 pixels, while a 3072 x 2048 image (from a 6.3 Megapixel digital camera) needs to store information for a whopping 6,291,456 pixels. We use algorithms which compress images to help reduce these file sizes. Image formats like jpeg and gif are common compressed image formats. Scaling down these images is easy but enlarging a bitmap makes it pixelated or simply blurred. Hence for images which need to scaled to different sizes, we use vector graphics.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vector-vs-raster-graphics/"> <b> HERE </b> </a> </p>
            <b>File extensions: .BMP, .TIF, .GIF, .JPG.</b>
            <center><img src="graphics/raster.jpg" style="width:60%"> </center>
            raster

            <h3>Vector Graphics :</h3>

             <p> Making use of sequential commands or mathematical statements or programs which place lines or shapes in a 2-D or 3-D environment is referred to as Vector Graphics. Vector graphics are best for printing since it is composed of a series of mathematical curves. As a result vector graphics print crisply even when they are enlarged. In physics: A vector is something which has a magnitude and direction. In vector graphics, the file is created and saved as a sequence of vector statements. Rather than having a bit in the file for each bit of line drawing we use commands which describe series of points to be connected. AS a result a much smaller file is obtained.</p>
             <b> File extensions : .SVG, .EPS, .PDF, .AI, .DXF.</b>

			<h3> Softwares of the Vectorized Graphics : </h3> 
            <li> Inkscape</li>
            <li> Illustrator. </li>
            <li> CorelDRAW.</li>

			<h3> Vector  Graphics In Inkspace : </h3>
			<p> for this task I have select The Inkscape it is a very simple tool that can be used for the 2D design, lets start some activity ,Inkscape can render primitive vector shapes (e.g. rectangles, ellipses, polygons, arcs, spirals, stars and 3D boxes) and text. These objects may be filled with solid colors, patterns, radial or linear color gradients and their borders may be stroked, both with adjustable transparency. Embedding and optional tracing of raster graphics is also supported, enabling the editor to create vector graphics from photos and other raster sources. Created shapes can be further manipulated with transformations, such as moving, rotating, scaling and skewing. </p>.
			<p>for the Vectorized I have download the image from the Google <a href="https://dlpng.com/png/6840828"> <b> IMAGE</b> </a>, And Import on the Insakspace , For  import the image by use the path function ==> <b> Trace Bitmaps </b>. At the time of vectorization you can draw the vector through three functions: brightness, border and color. and its Depending on the treshold you can set for the more clearances vector. </p>

			<h3> Raster VS Vectors </h3>
            <center><img src="graphics/vectrovsraster.jpg" style="width:60%"> </center>

			<h3> 3D design in Solid Work </h3>
			<p>3D modeling is the creation of a three-dimensional object inside of simulated software. The object can be created from simple shapes all the way up to complex high-polygon models. A polygon is one triangle, and It takes many triangles to make a circle or complex object.</p>

			<h3> 3D Design </h3>	
            <p> </p>
			<h3> Softwares Required : </h3>
			<li> SolidWorks.</li>
			<li> FreeCAD.</li>
			<li> Fusion 360.</li>

			<h3> Design In Free CAD</h3>
			<p> In this Assignemnt Ia hve use the free CAD Saftware , and I have Download FreeCAD from <a href="https://www.freecadweb.org/"> <b> IMAGE</b> </a> and Install It in PC. after That I have Design the Box that 20mm, 20mm and 20mm. For the Further more Design I will design in Other Weeks.</p>
			<p> First I Have set the axiss in free CAD</p>
			<center><img src="graphics/xyzplan.jpg" style="width:60%"> </center>
			<p> Then I have Create the Box in Free CAD </p>
			<center><img src="graphics/trangle.jpg" style="width:60%"> </center>
			<p> Now the Box Measuremnets </p>
			<center><img src="graphics/measure.jpg" style="width:60%"> </center>
			<p> Now this is the  Final BOX  That I Have Design </p>
			<center><img src="graphics/boxview.jpg" style="width:60%"> </center>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p> This Week is to Design the CAD design , This week was very Important for the CAD design tools I ahve Learned about the CAD design, the Major foucs was 2D design and 3D design, also Learned about the CAD design Parameters.</p>
