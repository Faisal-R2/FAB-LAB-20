Hello!

This is an example blog for the Fabricademy Course.

You can edit it on [Gitlab](http://gitlab.fabcloud.org). The software used turns simple text files
written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, into the site you are navigating.

Each time you change a page using the Gitlab interface the site is rebuilt and all the changes published 
in few minutes.

If this is your site, go on and edit this page clicking the Gitlab link on the upper right, changing the text below and deleting this.

No worries, you can't break anything, all the changes you make are saved under [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) using [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). This means that you have all the different versions of your page saved and available all the time in the Gitlab interface.
