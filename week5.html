				<p><b> Assignment: </b></p>
				<ul>
						<li>Task First is Group project: Test the design rules for your printer</li>
						<li> Task second is Design and 3D print an object (small, few cm) that  is Additive. </li>
						<li>Third Task Is 3D scan an object. </li>
				</ul>
				<p><u> Testing the design rules for the Printing the 3D Objects: </u></p>
				<p>First of all ,We have downloaded a standard test 3D file from the fab acadmey 2020 Cource and we have  printed two files by using Ultimaker 3D Printer.</p>
				<p> 3-D design Test  file is downloaded from here <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2656594">HERE</a></p>
				<center><img src="graphics/3dtest.jpg"></center>
				<p> File Setting in Cura for the Printing  </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/3ddesigntest.JPG"></center>
				<p> For the Printing We Need these Parameters: </p>
				<ul>
				 <li>I Have used the ultimaker User Manual for the Printing which is attached :</li> <a href="https://ultimaker.com/download/75113/Ultimaker2+_v2-0_EN.pdf">HERE</a> 
				 <p> Priting file and Test Printer :</p>
				<li>Size: the object is 4 x 50 x 50 mm (baseplate) â€” measure with a caliper</li>
				<li>Fine details: pyramid, cone, all numbers â€” check if all things look nice and smooth</li>
				<li>Minimum distance between walls: 0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5 mm depending on your nozzle size and slicer settings you will get different results</li>
				<li>Overhang: 25Â°/30Â°/35Â°, depending on printed material/cooling, these will not be as seen on the rendering provided</li>
				<li>Flatness: all flat areas these should be flat with no gaps</li>
				<p> Assignmets Print :</p>

				<p><b><u> Task to 3D Design and Printing ,3D Objects: </u></b></p>
				<p> In this Assignments i have Planed to Design the Olympiad Ring and we are Well Known from the  3D object Designing and printing is really attractive and Intertesting. For this I have decided design a non-subtractive object.  The first reason to choice this software is that we can design almost any object in it and can make its animation too. I have tried Fusion Solid Word Software. </p>
				
				<center><img src="graphics/ringolamp.png "></center>
				
				<p>  First , I want Design the 3D Design in Solid Work. I have open the Solid Work , First set the Plan And then Draw the Circle With 50mm outer and Inner 44mm Redius , and the Extude the Circle. after that again I have set the Plan at Draw the Agian second Circle. </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/design1.jpg"></center>
				<p>So, the Next I have Add one More Ring Parallel with other  with Same size .Here Attached in this Image.   </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/design2.jpg"></center>
			    <p> Now I am goig to add Fourth ring , but this ring is combine merage with First and Second Ring.</p>
			    <center><img src="graphics/design3.jpg"></center>
			    <p> This the Final 3D Olympiad Ring Look , Here Attached Iamge.</p>
                <center><img src="graphics/design4.jpg"></center>
                <p> Its Looks Fine with Sharp edges but  I feel these Sharp edges may be cut the human Skins so i want to remove the Sharp edges for my Design.Now Its Look Very Well. </p>
                <center><img src="graphics/design5.jpg"></center>
				<p> For the Printing the file  we need to export the . stl file to Cura.So first we have to set the Cura Setting of the 3D Design File Then send for the Printing. </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/curaring.jpg"></center>
				<p>3D Design after the Printing </p>
				<p>In this First 3D Printing design  attempt  not Successfully fine due to its orientation , my Design is not complete for the Final Phase, SO after this result , I agian Shift the orientation and agian print the file.</p>
				<p> First Attempt :</p>
				<center><img src="graphics/design3d1.jpg"></center>
				<p> Second Attempt: </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/design3d2.jpg"></center>
				<p> Third attempt: </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/design3d3.jpg"></center>				
				<p> Finally, I ahve changed the Orientations as well as some other changes than after the forth attempt my design is ready, because of retraction there was some PLA at unwanted places of the model that is why I did so much clean my Design but now it look more clear and Fine. </p>

				<p><b><u>3D scanning:</u></b></p>
				<p>3D scanning technology has always been out of reach to the consumer because of expense, complexity, and time. These scanning technologies often use expensive laser range sensors and scanning tables that require the user to be motionless for upwards of four minutes. Some pieces of software use photos from all around the subject to create the model. They use computer vision to detect the edges of objects and photo stitching techniques to make the 3d model. I have not had much success with photogrammetry as it often produced models that were not 3d printable. This 3d scanning technique uses an off-the-shelf Xbox Kinect and free software to create 3d models easily. </p>
				<ul>
					<li> For this task First I have planed to scan my self , so i have complete this task , i haved used Kinect Scaner and install the Skanect Software and its Supporting tools for the Scaning. </li>
					<li> Connect the 3D scanner with Pc and connect the Sensor Connectivity Here Attached the Images :</li>
				</ul>

				image_12_Skanect
				<p> Now I want Scan my Self :  </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/scan1.jpg"></center>
				<p><u>Observation:</u></p>
				<p> I  have observed during this scanning is that it is not a professional way to scan an object. But somehow it gives the concept of 3D scanning in very easy way.It very Interseting Task.</p>
				<p><u> I my Self scanning using XBOX-360.</u></p>
				<p>For this type of scanning I have found a really interesting object in lab That Is I am so I have paln to apply all the 3D scanning Rule on me. I decided to scan my self by  using XBOX-360 because of its size. Here is the image of this My self  </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/scan2.jpg" style="width:400;height:550;"></center>
				<p> XBOX-360 used for  scan my self. Following image shows the important scanning details and final scanning result. </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/scan3.jpg"></center>
				<p>The final scanning result is really good in term of detail, but unfortunately I have missed the hands of this cartoon for scanning due to small scanning area. I have reduced the area because of time taking by the Scanner. Overall Pneumatic scanning is really good option for 3D scanning of small object. </p>
				<p>Here is the another snapshot of final scan from another angle. </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/scan4.jpg"></center>
				<p> 3D scanning using Kinect is really an interesting part of this assignment, not only just interesting but fast also as compare to other methods. </p>
				<p> First I downloaded skanect 1.8 and installed it in my PC and took scanning with Kinect. After Scanning .stl file was generated.  </p>
				<center><img src="graphics/scan5.jpg"></center>
				<p>Now the final step is to export the model to Cura for printing,I have done the Cura printing setting but I Do not want to print my 3D Scaning design. </p>
				<p><u>Observation:</u></p>
				<p>This type of scanning is really great when we are scanning large objects. It also scan with really good detail and its fast as well. But we need to scan it carefully, if something goes wrong during scanning then we need to compensate it by using the Software setting.</p>
