                         <h2> Instructions :</h2>
                         <b>Important: you must weigh Part A & B components using a gram scale to be successful with Mold Max™ 60, for more details <a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/msds/files/823A-231B.pdf"> <b> HERE. </b> </b>

                         <p>Because no two applications are quite the same, a small test application to determine suitability for your project is recommended if performance of this material is in question.</p>
                         <b>Preparation :</b> <p>Materials should be stored and used in at room temperature (73°F/23°C). These products have a limited shelf life and should be used as soon as possible. Wear safety glasses, long sleeves and rubber gloves to minimize contamination risk. Rubber may be inhibited by sulfur base clays resulting in tackiness at the pattern interface or a total lack of cure throughout the mold. If compatibility between the rubber and the surface is a concern, a small-scale test is recommended. Apply a small amount of rubber onto a non-critical area of the pattern. Inhibition has occurred if the rubber is gummy or uncured after the recommended cure time has passed.</p>
                         <b> Applying A Sealer / Release Agent :</b> <p> To prevent inhibition, a “barrier coat” of clear acrylic lacquer sprayed directly onto the pattern is usually effective. Allow to thoroughly dry. Although not usually necessary, a release agent will make demolding easier when casting into or over most surfaces. Ease Release™ 200 is a proven release agent for making molds with silicone rubber and for releasing new silicone from cured silicone. Mann Ease Release™ products are available from Smooth-On or your Smooth-On distributor. IMPORTANT: To ensure thorough coverage, lightly brush the release agent with a soft brush over all surfaces of the model. Follow with light mist coating and let dry for 30 minutes.</p>
                         <b> Measuring & Mixing:</b><p> Before you begin, pre-mix Part A (base) thoroughly to re-disperse fillers that may have settled. Using a gram scale, dispense required amounts of parts A and B into a mixing container and mix for 3 minutes. Scrape the sides and bottom of the container several times. After mixing parts A and B, vacuum degassing is recommended to eliminate any entrapped air. Vacuum material for 2-3 minutes (29 inches of mercury), making sure that you leave enough room in container for product expansion.</p>
                         <b> Pouring / Curing / Post Curing :</b> <p>For best results, pour your mixture in a single spot at the lowest point of the containment field. Let the rubber seek its level up and over the model. A uniform flow will help minimize entrapped air. The liquid rubber should level off at least 1/2” (1.3 cm) over the highest point of the model surface. Allow the mold to cure overnight (at least 24 hours) at room temperature (73°F/23°C) before demolding. Post curing the mold an additional 4 - 5 hours at 125°F (51°C) will eliminate any residual moisture and alcohol that is a by-product of the condensation reaction. This water and alcohol can inhibit the cure of some casting resins. Allow mold to cool to room temperature before using. Do not cure rubber where temperature is less than 65°F /18°C.</p>
                         <b> Decreasing demold time with Accel-T™ Silicone Cure Accelerator:</b> <p> Important: Thoroughly Pre-mix Accel T™ with Part B before adding Part A.Be aware that the working time is drastically reduced with the addition of Accel T™. Also, library life of cured rubber is reduced in proportion to the amount of Accel-T™ added.</p>
                         <b> Using The Mold : </b> <p> New silicone rubber molds exhibit natural release characteristics. Depending on what is being cast into the mold, mold lubricity may be depleted over time and parts will begin to stick. No release agent is necessary when casting wax or gypsum. Applying a release agent such as Ease Release™ 200 (available from Smooth-On) prior to casting polyurethane, polyester and epoxy resins is recommended to maximize mold life. Visit Smooth-On’s FAQ section at www.smooth-on.com for information on a powder coating technique that will yield a dry matte finish to cured castings.</p>
                         <b> Mold Performance & Storage : </b> <p> The physical life of the mold depends on how you use it (materials cast, frequency, etc.). Casting abrasive materials such as concrete can quickly erode mold detail, while casting non-abrasive materials (wax) will not affect mold detail. Before storing, the mold should be cleaned with a soap solution and wiped fully dry. Two part (or more) molds should be assembled. Molds should be stored on a level surface in a cool, dry environment.</p>
		         

                        <h3>Casting Material <b> SMOOTH CAST-305 : </b></h3>
                        <h3>Introduction </h3>
                        <p> The Smooth-Cast® 300 Series of liquid plastics are ultra-low viscosity casting resins that yield castings that are bright white and virtually bubble free. Vacuum degassing is not necessary. They offer the convenience of a 1A:1B by volume or 100A:90B by weight mix ratio. The differences between them are pot life and demold time.</p>
                        <p> These resins readily accept fillers (such as URE-FIL® 3 from Smooth-On) and can be colored with SO-Strong® or Ignite® color tints (Smooth-Cast® 325 series accepts pigments better than the Smooth Cast® 300 series). Fully cured castings are tough, durable, machinable and paintable. They resist moisture and mild solvents. Applications for Smooth-Cast® 300 Series Liquid Plastics include reproducing small to medium size sculptures, making prototype models, special effect props and decorative jewelry, for more deatils <a href="https://www.smooth-on.com/products/smooth-cast-305/"> <b> HERE. </b> </b></p>

                        <h3> Instructions : </h3>
                        <p><b>Safety : </b> Materials should be stored and used in a warm environment (73° F / 23° C). These products have a limited shelf life and should be used as soon as possible. All liquid urethanes are moisture sensitive and will absorb atmospheric moisture. Mixing tools and containers should be clean and made of metal, glass or plastic. Mixing should be done in a well-ventilated area. Wear safety glasses, long sleeves and rubber gloves to minimize contamination risk.</p>
                        <p><b> Applying A Release Agent :</b> A release agent is necessary to facilitate demolding when casting into or over most surfaces. Use a release agent made specifically for mold making (Universal® Mold Release or Mann’s Ease Release® 200 available from Smooth-On or your Smooth-On distributor). A liberal coat of release agent should be applied onto all surfaces that will contact the plastic.</p>
                        <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> To ensure thorough coverage, apply release and brush with a soft brush over all surfaces. Follow with a light mist coating and let the release agent dry for 30 minutes. Smooth-On silicone rubber molds usually do not require a release agent unless casting silicone into the mold. Applying a release agent will prolong the life of the mold.</p>
                        <p><b>IMPORTANT: </b> Shelf life of product is reduced after opening. Remaining product should be used as soon as possible. Immediately replacing the lids on both containers after dispensing product will help prolong the shelf life of the unused product. XTEND-IT® Dry Gas Blanket (available from Smooth-On) will significantly prolong the shelf life of unused liquid urethane products.</p>
                        <p><b> Measuring and Mixing :</b> Liquid urethanes are moisture sensitive and will absorb atmospheric moisture. Mixing tools and containers should be clean and made of metal, glass or plastic. Materials should be stored and used in a warm environment (73°F/23°C).</p>
                        <p><b>Stir or shake both Part A & Part B thoroughly before dispensing: </b> After dispensing equal amounts of Parts A and B into mixing container (100A:90B by weight) and mix thoroughly. Stir deliberately making sure that you scrape the sides and bottom of the mixing container several times. Be careful not to splash low viscosity material out of the container.</p>
                        <p><b>Pouring : </b> Pour your mixture in a single spot at the lowest point of the containment field and let the mixture seek its level. This will help minimize air entrapment.</p>
                        <p><b>For Best Results :</b>  Best results are obtained using a pressure casting technique. After pouring the mixed compound, the entire casting assembly (mold, dam structure, etc.) is placed in a pressure chamber and subjected to 60 PSI (4.2 kg/cm2) air pressure for the full cure time of the material.</p>
                        <p><b>Curing </b> Important: Use this product with at least room size ventilation or in proximity to a forced outlet air vent and do not inhale/breath fumes. Fumes, which may be visible with a significant mass concentration, will quickly dissipate with adequate ventilation. Castings with significant mass may be hot to the touch and irritate skin immediately following cure. Let casting cool to room temperature before handling.</p>
                        <p>Demold time of the finished casting depends on mass and mold configuration. Low mass or thin-walled castings will take longer to cure than castings with higher mass concentration. Smooth-Cast® 305 will cure in 30 - 40 minutes (Smooth-Cast® 300 in 7 -10 minutes and Smooth-Cast® 310 in 2 - 4 hours) depending on mass and mold configuration.</p>
                        <p><b> Post Cure :</b> Castings will reach “full cure” faster and achieve maximum physical properties if post cured. Allow material to cure for recommended Cure Time at room temperature followed by 4 - 6 hours at 150°F/65°C. Allow casting to come to room temperature before handling.</p>
                        <p><b> Performance :</b> Cured castings are rigid and durable. They resist moisture, moderate heat, solvents, dilute acids and can be machined, primed/ painted or bonded to other surfaces (any release agent must be removed). If machining cured material, wear dust mask or other apparatus to prevent inhalation of residual particles. Castings can be displayed outdoors after priming and painting. Unpainted castings will yellow over time - more quickly when exposed to ultra-violet light,for more details <a href="http://www.resimax.com.au/Technical%20bulletins/Smooth-Cast_300q,_300,_305___310.pdf"> <b> HERE. </b></a></p>
