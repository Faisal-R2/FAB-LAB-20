                <h3> Introduction to ARM Microcontroller </h3>
                 <p> The ARM stands for Advanced RISC machine and it is a 32-bit  reduced instructions set computer (RISC) microcontroller. It was first introduced by the Acron computers’ organization  in 1987. The ARM is a family of the microcontroller developed by the different manufacturers such as ST microelectronics, Motorola and so on.  The ARM microcontroller architecture come with a few different versions such as ARMv1, ARMv2 etc and each one has its own advantage and disadvantages , for <a href="https://www.edgefx.in/arm-microcontroller-architecture-and-its-programming/"> <b> Details.</b></a></p>
                 <p>The ARM cortex microcontroller is an advanced microcontroller in the ARM family, which is developed by the ARMv7 architecture. The ARM cortex family divided into three sub-families such as.</p>
                 <li>ARM-Cortex Ax-series </li>
                 <li>ARM-Cortex Rx-series.</li>
                 <li>ARM-Cortex Mx-series.</li>
                 <h2> ARM Coretex-M3 Microcontroller Architecture </h2>
                 <p>The cortex-M3 ARM processor is a high performance 32-bit processor, which offers the significant benefits to the developers. The ARM architecture is a ‘Harward architecture’ which offers separate data and instruction buses for communicating with the  ROM and RAM memories. It consist a 3-stage pipeline to fetch, decode and execute the  instructions sequentially. The Cortex processor is a cost sensitive device which is used to reduce the processor area and has extensive improving interrupt handling and system debug capabilities. for more information<a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f415rg.pdf"> <b> Data sheet .</b></a></p>
                 <center><img src="graphics/arm.jpg" style="width:60%"> </center>
                 <p> The cortex-M3 arm processors are implemented by THUMB instruction set based on THUMB-2 technology, therefore, ensures high code density and reduce the program memory requirement. The cortex-m3 instruction set provides the excellent performance due to modern 32-bit architecture. The ARM processor core-m3 is closely integrated to Nested Vector Interrupt Controller (NVIC) to provide the good interrupt performance.<a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0087/e/DDI0087.pdf"> <b> Data sheet .</b></a></p>

                  <h2>PIC Micro Controller</h2>
                  <p>PIC is a Peripheral Interface Microcontroller which was developed in the year 1993 by the General Instruments Microcontrollers. It is controlled by software and programmed in such a way that it performs different tasks and controls a generation line. PIC microcontrollers are used in different new applications such as smartphones, audio accessories, and advanced medical devices.There are many PICs available in the market ranging from PIC16F84 to PIC16C84. These types of PICs are affordable flash PICs. Microchip has recently introduced flash chips with different types, such as 16F628, 16F877, and 18F452. The 16F877 costs twice the price of the old 16F84, but it is eight times more than the code size, with more RAM and much more I/O pins, a UART, A/D converter and a lot more features..for more details PIC mirco Controller list is here and Detils,<a href="http://www.microcontrollerboard.com/pic_memory_organization.html"> <b>Click HERE</b></a></p>
                  <h2>PIC Microcontrollers Architecture.</h2>
                  <p>The PIC microcontroller is based on RISC architecture. Its memory architecture follows the Harvard pattern of separate memories for program and data, with separate buses.for the data Sheets Click<a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/35007b.pdf"> <b>Click HERE</b></a> </p>

                  <h3> Memory Structure </h3>
                  <p>The PIC architecture consists of two memories: Program memory and Data memory.</p>
                  <p>Program Memory: This is a 4K*14 memory space. It is used to store 13-bit instructions or the program code. The program memory data is accessed by the program counter register that holds the address of the program memory. The address 0000H is used as reset memory space and 0004H is used as interrupt memory space.</p>
                  <p>Data Memory: The data memory consists of the 368 bytes of RAM and 256 bytes of EEPROM. The 368 bytes of RAM consists of multiple banks. Each bank consists of general-purpose registers and special function registers.</p>
                  <h2>Advantages of PIC Microcontroller:</h2>
                  <li>PIC microcontrollers are consistent and faulty of PIC percentage is very less. The performance of the PIC microcontroller is very fast because of using RISC architecture.</li>
                  <li>When comparing to other microcontrollers, power consumption is very less and programming is also very easy.</li>
                  <li>Interfacing of an analog device is easy without any extra circuitry.</li>
                  <h2> Disadvantages of PIC Microcontroller:</h2>
                  <li>The length of the program is high due to using RISC architecture (35 instructions).</li>
                  <li>One single accumulator is present and program memory is not accessible</li>

                <h2> Assisgnments Work :</h2>
				<p>In this week I have study about the Data sheet  and its a very important document of any electronic device/components as it contains all the information we need while using it. In case of microcontroller no other documents helps to understand it otherthan data sheet. Simply its free and authentic source of imformation regarding a device/component.</p>
				<p>Before going to selecting a microcontroller for any project we need to know the following things.</p>
				<ul>

                <h3> Important of  Miro Controller </h3>
				<li> First Find the Range of operating voltage.</li>
				<li> Second find the Speed: What is the highest speed a microcontroller supports? </li>
				<li> Third Find the Packaging: Is it DIP (dual inline package) or a QFP (quad flat package) or some other type? </li>
				<li> Fourth find the Power Consumption: Critical for battery powered products. </li>
				<li> Fifith is  The amount of RAM and ROM on chip </li>
				<li> last task is The number of timers and I/O pins on chip</li>
				</ul>
				<p>And Data sheet is the place where you can find the details of all above things of a microcontroller, The first think to read from data sheet is the specification of the microcontroller. I read the data sheet of ATtiny24/44/84A and ATmega32u4.</p>
                <p> I used to design the Embedded Board by using the ATMEGA32U4 </p>
