                 <h3> Intellectual Property : </h3>
                 <p> In general terms, intellectual property is any product of the human intellect that the law protects from unauthorized use by others.  The ownership of intellectual property inherently creates a limited monopoly in the protected property.  Intellectual property is traditionally comprised of four categories: <b> Patent </b>,<b> Copyright </b>, <b> Trademark </b> , and <b>Trade Secrets </b>.</p>
                 <b> Common Law </b>
                 <p> Common law did not recognize intellectual property rights. Justice Brandeis communicated this belief in his dissent to International News Service v. Associated Press:"The general rule of law is, that the noblest of human productions—knowledge, truths ascertained, conceptions, and ideas—become, after voluntary communication to others, as free as the air to common use.".</p>
