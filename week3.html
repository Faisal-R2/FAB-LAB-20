				<h3> Introdcution of Laser cut and Vinyl Cut</h3>
				<b> Laser Cut</b>
				<p>Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser, by computer at the material to be cut. The material then either melts, burns, vaporises or is blown away by a jet of gas leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat sheet material as well as structural and piping materials.
				Additionally, laser cutting easily adapts to ever-changing manufacturing demands, both in terms of production volume and market needs. The equipment used for laser cutting can be set up and repurposed for specific needs much faster than can the tools associated with traditional cutting processes. And since the materials cut with lasers typically do not require additional cleanup, the use of laser cutting increases throughput and eliminates other secondary operations, allowing the product to be made available to clients in less time.</p>
				<b> Vinyl Cut</b> 
                 <p>
                 	A vinyl cutter traces out shapes and graphics for precision cuts applicable to multiple facets of vinyl image transfers. These machines are used in the sign and t-shirt making industries and range from the small, portable desktop variant to large format machines used, amongst others, in the automobile and marine industries.

                     Able to run on simple or complex design software, textile vinyl rolls of varying thickness, density and application can be cut with an adjustable rotator knife, mounted as per requirement. Vinyl cutters differ in cutting force and speed depending on individual machine specifications.

                     With regards to stickers for the automobiles, lots of people might recommend using vinyl peel off stickers because they certainly look better than regular peel off stickers. In addition to that, the actual designs could be better maintained long-term using vinyl stickers.

                     People buy shirts along with beautiful and different styles. Occasionally, they would like to have that option of making their very own designs, as well, and also have those designs printed on their shirts. That should make a truly superb company. Whenever prior to, it was a little tougher to finish in a short span of time, we can currently obtain wonderful outcomes with vinyl cutters.

                    It could be examined just how much these vinyl cutters cost these days. Read with regard to truthful reviews of these types of publishing as well as graphic disciplines equipment.

			  <h3>Vinyl Cutting</h3>
				<p> In this Week I want to cut my Gray picture by using Vinyl cutter. For Perfoeming this Task I want Use tha Inkspace Sotware for the Image conversion.</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Open the Inkspace  Software and Select the Iamge for the Vinyl Cutter </li>
				<li> select the image and to the Path and Press the (shift+alt+B)for the trace bitmap </li>
				<li>Now a window while be open, from there select the "Gray image " at the window.</li>
				<li>Now ungroup the image and you while find many gray scale copies of your orignal image.</li>
				<li>Now to make it complete black and white from gray image just select the picture and change the colour to black</li>
				<li>Vinylcutter only cuts the Edges, so we need to get the outline of the image, we can get it easily with trace bitmap and then stoke in inkspace.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b> After all the Process, Now we have to convert the .svg file to  PNG image  for the Vinyl cutter  that is given below.</b></p>

                <p>  Operting and loading the Material in Vinyl Cutter for the Cutting</p>              
				<li>Insert the material in the vinylcutter and you will see the dimensions of the material on the small screen of vinylcutter</li>
                <center><img src="graphics/vinylprocess.jpg" style="width:80%"> </center>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Now open the cutstudio software of vinylcutter and import  for Cutting.</li>

				<h3> GROUP ASSIGNMENT: CHARACTERIZE YOUR LASERCUTTER'S FOCUS, POWER, SPEED, RATE,KERF, AND JOINT CLEARANCE.</h3>
				In this week we have to work on laser cutters. So first of all we need to charatarize the few things of laser cutter. One number is Kurf. When laser burn the material, the thickness or area of material which burn away are called kerf. The area(thickness)vary in order to measure the kurf of our laser cutter, we have design file in INKSPACE. First we measured the thickness of our material and then we have made rectangular boxes of different thickness with 0.05mm difference around the actual thickness of material. and also cutted the one long slit of same height. Idea is that which whole is perfect fit for that slit.

				<p>Testing kerf in different slots. 2.55mm suit best for 2.77-2.75mm</p>

				<h3>TEST CARD FOR POWER,SPEED,FOCUS,RATE</h3>
				<p> This File Downlaod by the Fab Acadmey 2020  course Week 5th Group Assignments </p>

				<br><br>
				 <p>The file was imported is rhino and processed for laser cutting job and this final Result which we have achived here.</p>
